# Describe the Problem

# The problem in the following code is that, when calling my_function(), "You got it"
# should print in the console. But nothing is printed on the console while executing 
# the code. Try to debug the code and see if "You got it" gets printed in the console,
# by just changing a value.

def my_function():
  for i in range(1, 20):
    if i == 20:
      print("You got it")
my_function()
