# Variable Naming

# 1. Make your code readable.

first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"

my_hobby = "Coding"

# 2. Variable names don't have spaces.

# first name = "John"

# 3. We can use numbers in our variables but not in the beginning.

# 1name = "Peter"
name1 = "Peter"

# 4. Don't use Python's reserved words as variable names.
