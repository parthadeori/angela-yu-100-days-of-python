# [Interactive Coding Exercise] Variables

# Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables 'a' and 'b' 
# For eg. If a = 3 and b = 5, then the console should print a = 5 and b = 3

# Don't change the code below.
a = input("a: ")
b = input("b: ")
# Don't change the code above.

### Write your code below this line. ###
c = a # Create a new variable 'c' and store the value of 'a'
a = b # Now, 'a' is empty, so store the value of 'b' inside 'a'
b = c # Now, 'b' is empty, so store the value of 'c' inside 'b'

# If a = 3 and b = 5
# c = a ---> c = 3
# a = b ---> a = 5
# b = c ---> b = 3
# Now, a = 5 and b = 3

### Write your code above this line. ###

# Don't change the code below.
print("a = " + a)
print("b = " + b)
# Don't change the code above.
